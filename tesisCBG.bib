However, practical experience with model calibration suggests that no single-objective function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails to match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several of the watershed output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there is a need for effective and efficient multi-objective calibration procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the physical system contained in the measurement data time series. The MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving the multiple-objective global optimization problem, is presented in this paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA single-objective global optimization algorithm. The features and capabilities of MOCOM-UA are illustrated by means of a simple hydrologic model calibration study. "

This study provides the most comprehensive diagnostic assessment of \{MOEAs\} for water resources to date, exploiting more than 100,000 \{MOEA\} runs and trillions of design evaluations. The diagnostic assessment measures the effectiveness, efficiency, reliability, and controllability of ten benchmark \{MOEAs\} for a representative suite of water resources applications addressing rainfallrunoff calibration, long-term groundwater monitoring (LTM), and risk-based water supply portfolio planning. The suite of problems encompasses a range of challenging problem properties including (1) many-objective formulations with four or more objectives, (2) multi-modality (or false optima), (3) nonlinearity, (4) discreteness, (5) severe constraints, (6) stochastic objectives, and (7) non-separability (also called epistasis). The applications are representative of the dominant problem classes that have shaped the history of \{MOEAs\} in water resources and that will be dominant foci in the future. Recommendations are given for the new algorithms that should serve as the benchmarks for innovations in the water resources literature. The future of \{MOEAs\} in water resources needs to emphasize self-adaptive search, new technologies for visualizing tradeoffs, and the next generation of computing technologies. "

Act I describes the pre-WWII formative period. Act \{II\} spans a period of confusion during which matrix methods assumed bewildering complexity in response to conflicting demands and restrictions. Act \{III\} outlines the cleanup and consolidation driven by the appearance of the direct stiffness method, through which \{MSA\} completed morphing into the present implementation of the finite element method (FEM). No attempt is made at chronicling the more complex history of \{FEM\} itself. "

Our approach lies in integrating an application for designing 2D and 3D bar structures, called Ebes, with the jMetal multi-objective optimization framework. The result is a software package that helps civil engineers to create bar structures which can be optimized further with multi-objective metaheuristics according to different goals, such as minimizing the structure weight and minimizing the deformation. The main features of both Ebes and jMetal are described and how they are combined together in one single tool is explained. Finally a case study to illustrate how the application works is presented.

  abstract = {The human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGFR) plays an important role in signaling pathways, such as cell proliferation and migration. Mutations like G719S, L858R, T790M, G719S/T790M or T790M/L858R can alter its conformation, and, therefore, drug responses from lung cancer patients. In this context, candidate drugs are being tested and in silico studies are necessary to know how these mutations affect the ligand binding site. This problem can be tackled by using a multi-objective approach applied to the molecular docking problem. According to the literature, few studies are related to the application of multi-objective approaches by minimizing two or more objectives in drug discovery. In this study, we have used four algorithms (NSGA-II, GDE3, SMPSO and MOEA/D) to minimize two objectives: the ligand–receptor intermolecular energy and the RMSD score. We have prepared a set of instances that includes the wild-type EGFR kinase domain and the same receptor with somatic mutations, and then we assessed the performance of the algorithms by applying a quality indicator to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the reference fronts. The MOEA/D algorithm yields the best solutions to these docking problems. The obtained solutions were analyzed, showing promising results to predict candidate EGFR inhibitors by using this multi-objective approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract The main objective of the molecular docking problem is to find a conformation between a small molecule (ligand) and a receptor molecule with minimum binding energy. The quality of the docking score depends on two factors: the scoring function and the search method being used to find the lowest binding energy solution. In this context, AutoDock 4.2 is a popular C++ software package in the bioinformatics community providing both elements, including two genetic algorithms, one of them endowed with a local search strategy. This paper principally focuses on the search techniques for solving the docking problem. In using the AutoDock 4.2 scoring function, the approach in this study is twofold. On the one hand, a number of four metaheuristic techniques are analyzed within an extensive set of docking problems, looking for the best technique according to the quality of the binding energy solutions. These techniques are thoroughly evaluated and also compared with popular well-known docking algorithms in AutoDock 4.2. The metaheuristics selected are: generational and a steady-state Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and Particle Swarm Optimization. On the other hand, a C++ version of the jMetal optimization framework has been integrated inside AutoDock 4.2, so that all the algorithms included in jMetal are readily available to solve docking problems. The experiments reveal that Differential Evolution obtains the best overall results, even outperforming other existing algorithms specifically designed for molecular docking. },
