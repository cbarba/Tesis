\section{Introduction}
Currently, the growing interest in Big Data applications~\cite{BD-challenges-2014}, where many of them require to process large amounts of data coming at great speed from streaming data sources, brings new opportunities to apply dynamic multi-objective optimization. The rationale is that both, Big Data and multi-objective optimization are found in many disciplines, such as: transportation, economics,
mobility, and medicine; so it is foreseeable that they converge in a near future leading to multi-objective Big Data optimization problems.
